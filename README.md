# visionHubOS

VisionHub is an operating system written to run on a very specific board I put together using an ESP32, an SSD1306 display and some input buttons. If you can understand what the code does, feel free to modify and use it for your usecases.

The kernel contains basic drivers to deal with the display and inputs, and has a basic process scheduler. Pins/Devices can be added or modified easily as needed through the already existing functions, or the drivers can easily be modified or extended for different use cases as well.

## Build and Run
It can only be built by divine intervention. Seriously. Email me if you plan to build it and I'll personally reach out to you with the rituals.
